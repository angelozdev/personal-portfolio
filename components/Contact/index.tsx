                I was born on December 17, 1997, in Bogot√°, Colombia. I am
                passionate about web technologies, mainly because of React. I
                love TypeScript. One of my greatest motivations is to learn. I
                started programming since I was in school learning from YouTube
                videos and online education platforms like Platzi and Udemy.
